# AesopRockCorpus

LIN222 Project, A corpus of Aesop Rock and his features in the Weathermen and WTMTIC
This project will be building a corpus of Aesop Rock's songs, a semantic analysis generator or his lyrics, and hopefully a phonetic breakdown of rhyme schemes. Computation will be done in Python with NLTK.
